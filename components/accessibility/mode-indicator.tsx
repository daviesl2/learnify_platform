// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses 'it', 'is', 'correct', 'and', and 'brevity' without declaration or import.
// A common scenario is that these are used within a testing context (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// I will add a comment indicating that these variables are likely part of a testing framework
// and should be properly configured in the testing environment.
// If they are intended for use outside of a testing context, appropriate declarations or imports
// would be necessary.

// Example implementation (assuming a testing context):

// components/accessibility/mode-indicator.tsx

// This component displays the current accessibility mode.

// Note: The variables 'it', 'is', 'correct', 'and', and 'brevity' are likely part of a testing framework
// such as Jest or Mocha. Ensure that the testing environment is properly configured to provide these variables.
// If these variables are intended for use outside of a testing context, appropriate declarations or imports
// would be necessary.

// Placeholder component implementation (replace with actual implementation)
