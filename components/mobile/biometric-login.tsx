// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within a testing context (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// Therefore, I will add a comment indicating that these variables are likely provided by the testing framework.
// If the variables are intended to be used outside of a testing context, further information would be needed to provide a more accurate solution.

// Assuming 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' are part of a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
// 'brevity' is an unusual variable name, but I will assume it's also part of the testing context.

// Example usage (replace with actual code if available):

// describe('Biometric Login Component', () => {
//   it('should render correctly', () => {
//     // brevity, it, is, correct, and and are likely provided by the testing framework.
//     const brevity = true; // Example - replace with actual usage if available
//     expect(brevity).toBe(true);
//   });
// });

// If the variables are not part of a testing framework, they need to be declared and initialized appropriately.
// For example:
// const brevity = someValue;
// const it = someFunction;
// const is = someOtherValue;
// const correct = anotherValue;
// const and = yetAnotherValue;

// Without the original code, I can only provide this general guidance.
// Please provide the original code for a more precise solution.
