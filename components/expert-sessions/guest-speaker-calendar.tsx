// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the code uses 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' without proper declaration or import.
// Without the original code, I can only provide a general solution by declaring these variables.
// A more accurate solution would require the original code to understand the context and purpose of these variables.

// Assuming these variables are boolean flags or simple values used within the component:

const brevity = true // Or false, depending on its intended use
const it = true // Or false, depending on its intended use
const is = true // Or false, depending on its intended use
const correct = true // Or false, depending on its intended use
const and = true // Or false, depending on its intended use

// The rest of the original component code would follow here, using these declared variables.
// For example:

function GuestSpeakerCalendar() {
  if (it && is && correct && and && brevity) {
    // Some logic here
    return <div>{/* Component content */}</div>
  } else {
    return <div>{/* Alternative content */}</div>
  }
}

export default GuestSpeakerCalendar

// Note: This is a placeholder solution.  A real solution requires the original code to determine the correct type, initial value, and purpose of these variables.  It's also possible that these variables should be imported from another module.
