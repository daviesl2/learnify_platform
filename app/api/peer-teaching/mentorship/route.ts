// No code provided to merge, but based on the updates, the issue is that variables brevity, it, is, correct, and and are undeclared.
// Assuming these are meant to be boolean variables used for assertions or checks, I will declare them at the top of the file.
// Without the original code, this is the best I can do.

let brevity: boolean
let it: boolean
let is: boolean
let correct: boolean
let and: boolean

// The rest of the original code would go here.  Since it was omitted, I cannot provide a complete merged file.
// This declaration addresses the errors described in the <updates> section.
